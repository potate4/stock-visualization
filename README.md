# What I learned from this project and the challenges I faced completing it
This project marked my first experience working with a Python backend, and I thoroughly enjoyed the process, particularly the graphing aspects with Chart.js, which were new to me.

# Learning Points:

1. Data Loading and Pagination:

Initially, loading the large CSV file caused significant delays whenever I refreshed the page. To address this, I implemented pagination, loading only 10 rows at a time, which greatly improved the application's performance in my local device.

2. Chart.js Integration:

While integrating Chart.js, I encountered several errors that I managed to resolve by watching a few tutorials and reading documentation. This greatly improved my understanding of data visualization in web applications.

3. Full-Stack Development:

I learned how to load data from a JSON file into a React app and store data in a database using a Python backend. This project provided me with valuable insights into full-stack development, CRUD operations, and effective data handling.


# Challenges:

1. Handling Large Datasets:

The size of the CSV file posed performance challenges. Implementing pagination was one way to making the application response better.

2. Learning Curve with Chart.js:

Understanding Chart.js and troubleshooting the errors required considerable effort and patience. However, this was a rewarding experience as it broadened my skill set.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
